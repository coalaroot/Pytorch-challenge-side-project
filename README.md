# [Funtorch] Sign Language Interpretation

A team of volunteers from PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook hosted by Udacity creating awesome Deep Learning models.

### Dataset
[Sign Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumawatmanish/deep-learning-sign-language-dataset/data)

### File Description
- main.py
    - Entry point of the application for detecting sign language gesture
- collect_data.py
    - Entry point of the application for creating new sign language data

### Setup
Run the following command to install all required python packages
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Detect Gesture
Run the following command to install all required python packages
```console
python main.py
```

##### Instructions
- Place your hand on the screen around the green boxes as shown on the figure below
- Press 'z' button to start hand detection
- Press 'z' button once again to stop hand detection
- Press ESC button to exit the application

### How to Add new image data
See the sign language number gesture in https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset

Run the following command to install all required python packages
```console
python collect_data.py
```

##### Instructions
- Press 'z' on your keyboard to start detecting hand
- Press 0-9 on your keyboard to change active label
- Press 'c' on your keyboard to capture a single data
- Press 's' on you keyboard to save all the captured data into file, the file will be located in the current application as X_{datetime}.npy and Y_{datetime}.npy
- Press 'd' on your keyboard to delete last recorded data
- Press ESC button to exit the application
